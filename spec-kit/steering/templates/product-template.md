## Core Business Flows

<!--
  MERMAID DIAGRAMS ARE MANDATORY - NOT OPTIONAL.

  Every business flow MUST be documented with Mermaid diagrams:
  - Use `sequenceDiagram` for user journeys, API interactions, service calls
  - Use `flowchart` for decision logic, process flows, state transitions

  Plain text descriptions are SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY, not replacements for diagrams.

  DO NOT use ASCII art or plain text to describe flows - ALWAYS use Mermaid syntax.
-->
